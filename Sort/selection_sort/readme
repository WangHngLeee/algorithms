# Selection Sort

#### Algorithm

* Find the smallest item
* Move it to the front
* Selection sort the remaining N-1 items (without touching the front item)

Time complexity: O(n^2)

#### Implementation

Suppose we have array {6, 3, 7, 2, 8, 1}. 

The target array is {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8}.

1. How to move the smallest to the front?

Swap the smallest with the old front. (In this case, swap 1 with 6, yielding {1, 3, 7, 2, 8, 6}).
