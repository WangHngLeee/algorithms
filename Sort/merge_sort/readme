# Merge Sort

#### Algorithm
1. If the list is size 1, return. Otherwise:
2. Mergesort the left half
3. Mergesort the right half
4. Merge the results

Time complexity: O(n*lgn)

Input:     [3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 4, 9]

expect:   [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]

* Merge Sort: [3] [2] [5] [6] [1] [4] [9]
* Merge: [3] [2, 5] [1, 6] [4, 9]
* Merge: [2, 3, 5] [1, 4, 6, 9]
* Merge: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]
