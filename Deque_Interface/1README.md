## Deque Interface

Use ArrayDeque.java and LinkedListDeque.java to build an **interface** Deque.java.

1. First goal is to indicate whether a word is a palindrome.

   Build Palindrome.java using Deque interface.

2. Second goal is to indicate whether a word is a Off-By-One palindrome.

   Build a helper function using a help **Interface** CharacterComparator.java which provide 

   character comparing method equalChars(char x, char y). 

   This method can compare whether two characters x and y are off-by-one or

   off-by-N. So this interface has OffByOne.java and OffByN.java implemented.

3. Last goal is to find palindrome in a file (word.txt)

   Build PalindromeFinder.java class.
